## SECTION 1 : PROJECT TITLE
## Food Image Classification


## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Singapore is considered a food haven and a favourite national topic by many spawning popular food blogs and long queues across the island. Given the huge focus on food and growing emphasis on healthy lifestyle, there is great potential in applying Computer Vision Deep Learning techniques to food classification. In this assignment, the A22G team showcases the motivation behind the project and the effectiveness of Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks and its variants.

The team also strives to share with the reader the teamâ€™s journey to develop highly effective Deep Learning vision models while overcoming challenges like overfitting and training deep models by applying best practices. The team would also like to share empirical nuggets of wisdom gained from this journey when implementing various network architecture from scratch and techniques employed.
